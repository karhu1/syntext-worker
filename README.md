# syntext-worker
A fun side project for a discord bot for the Syntext server! 

End goals that would be good to get done include:
1. An easy way to set up meetings
2. A way to record/bookkeep notes.
3. Anything else!

To set up modules, run this command in the console, `npm i discord.js discord-api-types #discordjs/rest dotenv chalk@4.1.2`.
